## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Clean Architecture**
   - Perfect inheritance structure: MemoryTemplate -> FileTemplate -> TwigTemplate
   - Single Responsibility Principle well followed
   - Method overrides correctly implemented

2. **Type Safety**
   - PHP 8.2+ type hints fully utilized
   - Return types clearly defined
   - Property types clearly defined

3. **Error Handling**
   - Exceptions properly used (RuntimeException, InvalidArgumentException)
   - Exception messages are clear and understandable
   - Error codes properly configured

4. **Documentation**
   - PHPDoc complete and detailed (enhanced 2025-12-17)
   - Detailed `@param`, `@return` descriptions on all methods
   - Return type declarations complete (`void`, etc.)
   - Array type annotations added (`array<string, mixed>`)
   - Method descriptions are clear
   - Parameters and return types are clear

5. **Test Coverage**
   - 98.72% line coverage
   - All public methods tested
   - Edge cases tested

### Areas for Improvement

1. **FileTemplate Coverage**
   - 1 method (80%) coverage is low
   - Edge cases for `file()` method could be added

2. **Exception Testing**
   - Some exceptions could be tested in more detail
   - Test exception message formats

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Performance tests with many large templates could be added
   - Memory usage tests could be added
